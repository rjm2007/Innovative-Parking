## 🌟 Project Overview

This project implements an advanced **Smart Parking Space Detection System** using state-of-the-art computer vision techniques. The system can:
- Detect available parking spaces in real-time
- Track vehicle occupancy using YOLOv8 object detection
- Provide real-time analytics on parking space utilization
- Support multiple parking zones with custom naming
- Process video feeds for continuous monitoring

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV for image processing and real-time video analysis
- **Deep Learning**: YOLOv8 for state-of-the-art object detection
- **Data Management**: Pickle for efficient data serialization
- **User Interface**: Interactive polygon drawing for parking space definition
- **Performance Optimization**: Multi-threading for non-blocking operations

## 🚀 Key Features

1. **Real-time Vehicle Detection**
   - Utilizes YOLOv8 for accurate car detection
   - Processes video feeds at optimized frame rates
   - Maintains high accuracy with minimal computational overhead

2. **Smart Space Management**
   - Custom polygon-based parking space definition
   - Real-time occupancy tracking
   - Dynamic space availability updates

3. **Advanced Analytics**
   - Real-time car counting
   - Available space calculation
   - Zone-based occupancy statistics

4. **User-Friendly Interface**
   - Interactive space definition
   - Real-time visual feedback
   - Custom zone naming system

## 📊 Technical Implementation

The system consists of two main components:

1. **Space Definition Module** (`test2.py`)
   - Interactive polygon drawing interface
   - Persistent storage of parking space configurations
   - Multi-threaded data saving

2. **Detection and Analysis Module** (`test3.py`)
   - YOLOv8-based vehicle detection
   - Real-time space occupancy analysis
   - Performance-optimized frame processing

## 🎯 Performance Metrics

- Real-time processing at 30+ FPS
- High accuracy vehicle detection
- Low latency space availability updates
- Efficient memory management
